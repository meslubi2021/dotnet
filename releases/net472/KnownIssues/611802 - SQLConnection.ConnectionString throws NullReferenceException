# NullReferenceException while setting `SqlConnection.ConnectionString` to an empty string or null.
## Symptoms

When an application tries to set the `ConnectionString` property of the `SqlConnection` object a `NullReferenceException` is thrown

## Cause

.NET Framework 4.7.2 includes changes for increasing the default retry count to Azure SQL DB to 2. 
The code change sets the internal value of retry count without validating if the ConnectionString is a non-null or non-empty value
which results in the NullReferenceException

## Impact

The applications using SqlConnection.ConnectionString API to set an empty connection string will receive an exception.

## Workarounds

No Known workarounds yet with .Net 4.7.2.

## Resolution

Product team working on code fix.
